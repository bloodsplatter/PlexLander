## About

This project is my attempt at creating a landing page for my Plex server. Right now it is pre-pre-pre-....-alpha. AKA: there's nothing there and it's shit.

## Configuration

Almost all configuration is done after the server is started, in the settings menu. However, currently there is no image upload. You have to manually put the launcher icons in `wwwroot/images/`. Preferably 512x512 PNG images (for transparency).
